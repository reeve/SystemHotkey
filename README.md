# SystemHotkey
A simple utility library to listen to Windows hotkeys

NOTE: This code originally came from https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3055/System-Hotkey-Component
The license is unknown/unspecified, but believed to be available for use. My plan is to replace this library with something else with a more specific license.
